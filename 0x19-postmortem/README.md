Postmortem: Website Outage Due to Database Overload

Issue Summary:

On October 15th, 2023, from 2:00 PM to 5:30 PM GMT, our primary customer-facing website experienced a significant outage, affecting approximately 70% of our users. During this period, users encountered slow page loads, and for a substantial number, the service was entirely inaccessible. The root cause was identified as an overloaded database server, which became unresponsive due to an unexpectedly high volume of requests.

Timeline:

- **2:00 PM GMT** - Monitoring alerts for database response times were triggered, indicating an issue.
- **2:10 PM GMT** - Initial investigation by the on-call engineer focused on a potential spike in traffic, suspecting a DDoS attack.
- **2:35 PM GMT** - After ruling out external attacks, the investigation shifted towards internal system checks, particularly the database.
- **2:50 PM GMT** - The database management team was alerted and began deeper diagnostics.
- **3:15 PM GMT** - A misleading assumption was made regarding a software update causing the issue.
- **4:00 PM GMT** - The actual problem was identified: an inefficient database query causing excessive loads under high user traffic.
- **4:45 PM GMT** - A hotfix was deployed to optimize the query, and additional resources were allocated to the database server.
- **5:30 PM GMT** - Service was restored to full functionality after monitoring confirmed the resolution's effectiveness.

Root Cause and Resolution:

The outage was triggered by an inefficient database query that, under typical conditions, did not pose a problem. However, the increase in user traffic on the day in question led to this query creating a bottleneck, significantly degrading database performance. The resolution involved quickly identifying and optimizing the problematic query, alongside scaling up the database infrastructure to better handle peak loads. These steps brought the service back online.

**Corrective and Preventative Measures:**

To prevent a similar incident from occurring in the future, we have identified several measures:

1. **Optimize Database Queries:** Conduct a comprehensive review and optimization of all existing database queries.
2. **Implement Advanced Query Monitoring:** Enhance monitoring tools to detect inefficient queries and performance bottlenecks in real-time.
3. **Upgrade Database Scalability:** Improve the database system's scalability to dynamically adjust to varying loads.
4. **Refine Alerting Mechanisms:** Update the alerting system to more accurately differentiate between types of load and potential issues.
5. **Regular Stress Testing:** Introduce regular stress testing of the system to identify weaknesses under simulated high traffic conditions.

**Tasks to Address the Issue:**

Review and optimize database queries by November 30th, 2023.
Set up enhanced query performance monitoring by December 15th, 2023.
Plan and implement database scalability improvements by January 20th, 2024.
Update alerting mechanisms for better accuracy and differentiation by February 5th, 2024.
Schedule and conduct the first system-wide stress test by March 15th, 2024.

This incident has underscored the importance of continuous monitoring and optimization of our systems to adapt to changing conditions and user demands. By implementing the above measures, we aim to significantly enhance the resilience and reliability of our service, minimizing the risk of future outages.
